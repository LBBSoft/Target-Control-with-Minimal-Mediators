# Target-Control-with-Minimal-Mediators
Target Controllability with Minimal Mediators in Complex Biological Networks.
The proposed methodology has potential applications in any directed networks,
Based on path lengths between node pairs and meets Kalmanâ€™s controllability rank condition. Thus, it does not have the restrictions of the structural controllability
Since in the process of controlling the target nodes by the driver identified using our proposed method, the fewest possible non-target nodes get in the way of control signals, not only the harmful side effects of target control will be fewer but also the amount of time required to control will also be less. Moreover, the less the control signals are attenuated, the more the positive effects of control will be.
The structure of the 8 real networks is as the adjacency lists
